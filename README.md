# Classification and Forecasting of Weather Data

## Classification:
Used different classification algorithms to classify weather data based on four parameters: precipitation, max temperature, min temperature, and wind speed. The models were trained on the Seattle weather dataset.

## Forecasting: 
Used Neural Prophet for forecasting weather data. The model was trained on data collected from HAL in Bengaluru in 1950.

All datasets and models can be found in the respective repositories.
